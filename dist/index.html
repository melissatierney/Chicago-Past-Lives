          <h1>About Past Lives</h1>
          <p>The idea of reincarnation, living again after death, is as old as time. There are numerous references to it in the old and new testaments of the Bible. In the 1920s, Edgar Cayce, at the time an internationally famous clairvoyant and medical prophet, provided as much evidence for past lives as possible through his verified psychic readings of people. The past lives he saw provided clues and healing for current unexplained physical, psychological, and emotional conditions people were experiencing.</p>
          <p>In the 1950s, after the advent and acceptance of hypnotherapy, psychiatrist Dr. Ian Stevenson and his team at the University of Virginia and the university’s medical doctors began exploring the idea of healing what they considered to be psychosomatic illnesses by hopefully regressing people to a hidden event in their childhood. What happened instead astonished everyone. People most often regressed to another lifetime! It was completely unexpected, and turned everything they were doing upside down. Yet, people remembering these lifetimes, with trained guidance, were healed of the unexplained physical and mental conditions and illness.</p>
          <p>Dr. Ian Stevenson had trouble believing. He was a classically trained medical doctor. From then on, he made it his life work to disprove the phenomena. Going to extreme measures, he hired independent detectives and actors to try and fool people who had remembered lifetimes. Yet none of them changed their stories, and the remembered lifetimes were verified through rigorous methods. Dr. Stevenson’s work was obsessive and exhaustive, yet the only statement he would make after all of it was this: There is no conclusive evidence capable of disproving reincarnation.</p>
          <p>Truly, what evidence could exist that would <i>prove</i> past lives? </p>

          <p>From science-based Mary Elizabeth Raines, internationally respected Hypnosis Trainer and Past Life Regressionist, who has performed literally thousands of regressions for over 40 years, we hear this:</p>
          <p>Whether reincarnation is actual fact or fantasy, however, doesn’t really matter. What does matter is that people find the answers and release/relief they are seeking. Any information that helps an individual’s self-understanding is valuable, whether its source is from a former existence in another body, or whether it arises from a person’s present-day subconscious.</p>
          <p>In my experience, in hundreds of past life regressions I have performed and experienced for myself as my own regressions, I can honestly say that if someone (or myself) has made that up, WHY did they make that up, and where did those details come from? Why does no one come back as Cleopatra, or a King or Queen? If I were to make something up, it would be grand, like a movie. Yet the majority of regressions are sweet precious lives filled with love, or where a personal tragedy has occurred that scarred them deeply.</p>
          <p>I believe, because I have seen the release and the healing, the RELIEF.</p>
          <p>Maybe you will choose to take this adventure into your deeper self!</p>
